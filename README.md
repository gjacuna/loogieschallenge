# 🌳 Koywe Trees
Submission to the SVG NFT challenge.

I didn't focus much on the art side of things, but rather the game dynamics. You can mint trees (dynamic color and leafiness) paying with BCT (base carbon tokens, from Toucan protocol). All proceeds will either plant real trees or retire the BCT's using toucan tools. The outcome is determined using the same predictable randomness from the nft's attributes.

# Noticeable differences
> You need to pay with ERC20 tokens to be able to mint. **Be sure to update the deploy script or Collectible contract to make it work locally or on testnets**
> Don't forget to modifiy the **KoyweTreesMint** component to point to the right ERC20 contract or disable that functionality altogether.

Enjoy! And don't forget to "plant" (mint) some Koywe Trees on https://app.koywe.eco !

# 🏗 Scaffold-ETH

> everything you need to build on Ethereum! 🚀

🧪 Quickly experiment with Solidity using a frontend that adapts to your smart contract:

# 🏄‍♂️ Quick Start

Prerequisites: [Node (v16 LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) plus [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

> clone/fork 🏗 scaffold-eth:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth.git
```

> install and start your 👷‍ Hardhat chain:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn install
yarn chain
```

> in a second terminal window, start your 📱 frontend:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn start
```

> in a third terminal window, 🛰 deploy your contract:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn deploy
```

🔏 Edit your smart contract `YourContract.sol` in `packages/hardhat/contracts`

📝 Edit your frontend `App.jsx` in `packages/react-app/src`

💼 Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/hardhat/deploy`

# 💌 P.S.

🌍 You need an RPC key for testnets and production deployments, create an [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) account and replace the value of `ALCHEMY_KEY = xxx` in `packages/react-app/src/constants.js` with your new key.

📣 Make sure you update the `InfuraID` before you go to production. Huge thanks to [Infura](https://infura.io/) for our special account that fields 7m req/day!
